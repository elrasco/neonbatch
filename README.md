[Serveless AWS deploy](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/)

The `sls deploy` command deploys your entire service via CloudFormation.  
Run this command when you have made infrastructure changes (i.e., you edited serverless.yml). 

Use `sls deploy function -f myFunction` when you have made code changes and you want   
to quickly upload your updated code to AWS Lambda or just change function configuration.
